To create an RFID attendance system with an LCD screen that only allows registered cards, you will need the following components:

1. Arduino Uno or compatible board
2. RFID reader module (such as RC522)
3. LCD screen (16x2)
4. Breadboard
5. Jumper wires
6. RFID cards/tags
7. Resistors

Here are the steps to create the RFID attendance system with an LCD screen:

1. Connect the RFID reader module to the Arduino board as follows:
  - SDA pin to Arduino pin 10
  - SCK pin to Arduino pin 13
  - MOSI pin to Arduino pin 11
  - MISO pin to Arduino pin 12
  - IRQ pin is not connected
  - GND pin to GND
  - RST pin to Arduino pin 9
  - 3.3V pin to 3.3V

2. Connect the LCD screen to the Arduino board as follows:
  - GND pin to GND
  - VCC pin to 5V
  - SDA pin to Arduino pin A4
  - SCL pin to Arduino pin A5

3. Connect a resistor between the Arduino pin 9 and 3.3V. This will ensure that the RFID reader module is always powered on.

4. Upload the following code to the Arduino board:

```

```

5. Replace "12345678" with the ID of the registered card. You can find the ID by running the example "DumpInfo" sketch that comes with the MFRC522 library.

6. Connect the RFID cards/tags to the system.

7. Test the system by scanning the registered card. The LCD screen should display "Welcome!" and stay on for one second before clearing and displaying "RFID Attendance". If an unregistered card is scanned, the LCD screen should display "Unregistered card" and stay on
